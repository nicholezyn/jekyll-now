# Maybe You Heard About Hinds?
if you Hinds, you may want to read this. with their newly released song " i don't run", this Spanish indie band has made their way in to the critics' love. The Spanish four-piece break no boundaries, but they're having a bloody blast

There’s a track on Hinds’ second album that’s so immediate and warm that you’d swear the chorus belongs to a much more familiar, famous song. It doesn’t, but that’s the power of ‘New For You’, a catchy, gloriously scrappy summation of all that the four-piece does best. Built around a scratchy, freewheelin’ guitar riff and chanted vocals (“I wanna be somebody new for you!“), this is the thrilling sound of being young, dumb and – as the band bawls on ‘Tester’ – “just having fun”.

Madrid-based Hinds (formerly Deers, their name changed when American band The Dears threatened legal action) are lead songwriters Carlotta Cosials and Ana García Perrote alongside bassist Ade Martín and drummer Amber Grimbergen. Back in 2014, the band – then a two-piece that consisted of Ana and Carlotta – moved away the tables at Carlotta’s aunt’s vegetarian restaurant and played a chaotic, impromptu show right there. It was a success, unlike Hinds’ second-ever performance, which was so disastrous that they split for two years.

# Ps.I never listen to the song, let alone know every little details about this new band. i just stole the words above from NME. This is a test run and i know nobody would read this so why write it myself lol
